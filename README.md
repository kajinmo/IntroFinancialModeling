# Udemy's course "Introduction to Financial Modeling for Beginners" Case Study

The Case Study is involving our client, Lucy, which is is the lemonade stand owner in her neighborhood.

She is done quite well and wants to know what can I expect in terms of sales this coming year.

So that's what we're going to do:
- Financial Forecasting Model - a model that takes existing performance and projects it into the future so we can see what that might look like.
- Financial Reporting Model - a model that compares actuals versus forecast to figures where there may be opportunities to improve Lucy's business.
- Financial Decision-Making Model - Now Lucy has a competitor and want to buy his business. We're going to build a financial decision making model that's going to help Lucy decide whether she should buy Frankie's business and if so, how much she should pay for it.
