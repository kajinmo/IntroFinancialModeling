She is done quite well and wants to know what can I expect in terms of sales this coming year.

So that's what we're going to do:
- Financial Forecasting Model - a model that takes existing performance and projects it into the future so we can see what that might look like.
- Financial Reporting Model - a model that compares actuals versus forecast to figures where there may be opportunities to improve Lucy's business.
- Financial Decision-Making Model - Now Lucy has a competitor and want to buy his business. We're going to build a financial decision making model that's going to help Lucy decide whether she should buy Frankie's business and if so, how much she should pay for it.
